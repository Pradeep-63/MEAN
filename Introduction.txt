Q-What is NodeJs ?
Ans:Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.Ryan Dahl developed it in 2009 and its latest version is 22.5.1,was realsed in 2024-07-19.It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is designed to be lightweight and efficient. Node.js is often used for building scalable network applications, such as web servers and real-time applications.The frameworks of NodeJs is ExpressJs,NestJs,KoaJs and SailsJs.
Q-Why NodeJs?
Ans:-NodeJs is built on Google Chromeâ€™s V8 engine, and for this reason its execution time is very fast and it runs very quickly.
-As NodeJs do not need to wait for an API to return data , so for building real time and data intensive web applications, it is very useful.
-Node.js is cross-platform, meaning it can run on various operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, allowing for a more unified  development process.
Q-How NodeJs works ?
Ans:-When a client sends a request to a Node.js server, the request is added to an event queue. The event loop continuously checks this queue and processes each request. If a request involves an I/O operation, Node.js offloads it to the system kernel, which handles it asynchronously. Once the I/O operation is complete, the kernel notifies Node.js, executing the corresponding callback function.This non-blocking I/O and event-driven model allows Node.js to handle many simultaneous connections efficiently, making it ideal for building scalable, high-performance network applications.
Q-Advantages of NodeJs ?
Ans:-Node.js offers several advantages that make it an attractive choice for server-side development.The following are some advantages of NodeJs:
1.Fast and Scalable:-Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast and scalable.
     2.JavaScript Everywhere:-Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end, making it a popular choice for full-stack development.
     3.Large Ecosystem:- Node.js has a massive ecosystem of packages and modules, with over 2 million packages available on Node Package Manager.
     4.Cross-Platform:- Node.js can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
     5.Real-Time Applications: Node.js is well-suited for real-time applications such as live updates and gaming.
Q-Features of NodeJs ?
Ans:-Node.js has several features that make it a powerful and flexible runtime environment for server-side development.The following are some features of NodeJs:
  1.Asynchronous and Event-Driven:- Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.
  This allows Node.js to handle many connections simultaneously with high throughput.
  2.Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable:- Despite being single-threaded, Node.js can handle a large number of simultaneous connections thanks to its event loop and asynchronous nature.
  3.Built on V8 JavaScript Engine:- Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google which ensuring fast execution.
  4.Node Package Manager:- Node.js includes npm, a package manager that provides access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules.
  npm allows developers to easily manage project dependencies and share code with the community.
 5.Cross-Platform Compatibility:- Node.js can run on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, providing flexibility in deployment and development.
Q-Application of NodeJs ?
Ans:-Node.js is suitable for various applications, including:
 I.Real-time chats
 II.Complex single-page applications
 III.Real-time collaboration tools
 IV-Streaming apps
