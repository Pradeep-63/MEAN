Q-Difference between MySQL and MongoDB?
Ans:-
MySQL:
-MySQL is an open source relational database management system.
-In MySQL,each individual records are stored as a rows in a table.
-SQL database can be scaled vertically.
-MySQL requires a schema definition for the tables in the database.
-MySQL uses SQL which is a structure query language.
-It has primary key constraints.
MongoDB:
-MongoDB is an open source non-relational database management
system.
-In MongoDB, each individual records are stored as a documents.
-MongoDB database can be scaled both vertically and horizontally.
-MongoDB does not require any prior schema.
-MongoDB uses the MongoDB query language(MQL).
-it does not has primary key constraints,instead object id is system
generated id which is unique to each document.
Q-Introduction to MongoDb ?
Ans:-
-MongoDB is a powerful NoSQL database designed for storing and managing large sets of unstructured or semi-structured data. It is known for its high performance, flexibility, and scalability, making it a popular choice for modern applications
-MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in documents rather than in rows and columns as in traditional relational databases. These documents are stored in a format called BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for rich data types and easy data representation.
Q-Key concepts of MongoDb ?
Ans-
Database: A container for collections. Each database has its own set of files on the file system.
Collection: A group of MongoDB documents. A collection is the equivalent of a table in a relational database. 
Document: A record in a MongoDB collection and the basic unit of data. Documents are analogous to rows in a relational database table. Each document is a set of key-value pairs.
Q-Why we use MongoDb ?
Ans:-MongoDB is used for various reasons, primarily due to its flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages over traditional relational databases. Here are some key reasons why MongoDB is popular:
1.Document:-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (BSON), allowing fields to vary from document to document and accommodating data of any structure.
2.Indexing: -For efficient searching Indexing is a must and MongoDB uses it to process huge volumes of data in very less time.
3.JSON-like Format: The JSON-like document format makes it easy for developers to work with data in MongoDB, especially those familiar with JSON from web development.
4.Load balancing. MongoDB can be used to run over multiple servers.
5.Schema-less. MongoDB is a schema-less database, which means the database can manage data without the need for a blueprint.
6.Scalability. MongoDB supports vertical and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling works by adding more power to an existing machine, while horizontal scaling works by adding more machines to a user's resources.
Q-Where do we use MongoDB ?
Ans:-MongoDB is preferred over RDBMS in the following scenarios:
 I.Big Data: If we have huge amount of data to be stored in tables, think of MongoDB before RDBMS databases. MongoDB has built-in solution for partitioning and sharding our database.
 II.Unstable Schema: Adding a new column in RDBMS is hard whereas MongoDB is schema-less. Adding a new field does not effect old documents and will be very easy.
 III.Aggregation Framework: Powerful tools for real-time data aggregation and analysis.
Q-Advantages of MongoDB .
Ans:- MongoDB offers several potential benefits:
1.Schema-less. Like other NoSQL databases, MongoDB doesn't require predefined schemas. It stores any type of data. This gives users the flexibility to create any number of fields in a document, making it easier to scale MongoDB databases compared to relational databases.
2.Scalability. A core function of MongoDB is its horizontal scalability, which makes it a useful database for companies running big data applications
